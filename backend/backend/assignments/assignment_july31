you have to create a registration feature where users can be registered Means:
1)Create a user model
fields are username, email,password,createdAt with data type as Date, company as user's company where he is workng. 
THe company model has 3 fields name,location and address. 

2) we need a controller with 2 features. 1) view all users 2) create a user 
You will keep the routes in the user route in routes/users.the paths should be
	1) get users: --> list all users
	2) create a user. 
	3) get user details with company. you should also get company details in the response

3) Create API to get user by email. 
4) create api where we can pass user email and it should only return username and password. dont return any other value.
